          <h2>2. Zero Tolerance for Destruction</h2>
          <p>
            We will remove you immediately and without warning if you:
          </p>
          <ul className="ml-4 mt-2 list-disc">
            <li>Harass, threaten, or target other members</li>
            <li>Post illegal content, spam, or malware</li>
            <li>Attempt to damage, exploit, or disrupt the platform</li>
            <li>Impersonate other users or organizations</li>
            <li>Use the platform to harm children or vulnerable people</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2">
            There is no appeals process for destructive behavior. Builders build — destroyers get removed.
